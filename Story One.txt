My name is Andrew Speich, and this is my story.

Sometimes things happen for a reason, and sometimes things just happen. Walking through the woods on a bright, sunny, spring day. 
A young boy comes across a small animal squirming under a log that had fallen. the child looken at the creature and thought it was a snake from the way it writhed.
the young boy didn't like snakes, due to a bite he recieved some years ago. but he knew that being good was rewarding, so he pushed the log over and let the snake go free.
